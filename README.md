Project Description

This project is a recreation of the historic newspaper “امروز (Daily Imroze)”, originally published from Lahore and Karachi. I designed the layout using HTML and inline CSS to replicate a vintage 1949 newspaper style, focusing on column structure, bold headlines, and advertisement panels. The goal was to mimic the traditional print newspaper appearance using modern web layout techniques.

Features Implemented

Flexbox-based 3-column layout

Structured <div> containers for newspaper sections

Styled headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h4>) for headline hierarchy

Inline CSS for borders, spacing, and typography

Column separation using border-left styling

Image integration for main article

Vintage design theme using background colors and letter spacing

Challenges Faced

One major challenge was aligning multiple columns properly to resemble a traditional newspaper layout. I solved this by using Flexbox and adjusting margins, borders, and spacing carefully to maintain balance and readability.
